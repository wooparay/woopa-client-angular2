*  check the user for the git upload
A. cat the .git/config file and check the [remote "origin"] url property, 
   you might need to add back the "user" to the url
   e.g. url = https://wooparay@github.com/wooparay/woopa-server.git

*  opening a branch
A. I have not found a way to create a local branch and then push it to the remote though; 
   by the meantime, I create on the git website
D. as by git 1.7, a new option could fulfill the needs
   git checkout -b <branch>
   git push -u origin <branch>
